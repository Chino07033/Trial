  <p><h2> I'm Emmanuel De Vera.<br>
  A Multimedia Artist<br> based in the Philippines</h2></p>
  <p>I'm probably the most zealous designer you'll ever get to collaborate with. <br>If you have an idea that needs fabricating with, I'm your guy</p>
  <p>I actually never thought that I'd take multimedia arts as a course in college <br> but look at me now, enjoying the life of animating 3d objects and editing <br> videos as a part of my hobby. 
  <p> Let me tell you a story before I embarked on my journey in becoming a <br> multimedia artist, First of all, I'm not your typical guy who's really inclined <br> into arts before I started going to college, I never 
  even thought that I'd take <br> this course and study it neveralone enjoy it at the same time. The only reason <br> why I became a multimedia artist is because of my family's influence, and fast <br> forward to today, here I am
  enjoying and continuously mustering my craft.<br>
